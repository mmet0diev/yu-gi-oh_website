# Yu-Gi-Oh website

A fanmade Yu-Gi-Oh website consisting of 4 pages, describing different aspects of yu-gi-oh,
the anime, the game and it's rules, and other things in regards to yu-gi-oh.

There are 4 pages, home, characters, collections and compose.

The home page gives a brief description of Yu-Gi-Oh as a card game, it's origin, it's creators and
the official animated series, with some links to official yu-gi-oh sources.

The characters page gives brief descriptions of the main characters in the series.

The collections page, displays the collections of cards in the website(stored locally), and has
a search bar with which the user can find a card either by name, type or letter contained in the card.

The compose page, has a little tool that allows the user to build a deck consisting of 40 to 50 cards.
In the official anime the decks could be up to 60 cards and have duplicate cards up to 3 in a deck,
but I tought it would be better to have a shorter deck consisting only of unique cards per deck.
There are 2 sections one with the cards to pick from and another to drag and drop selected cards.
There is a clear button if the user wishes to clear the currently build deck and start over, and a save button, when pressed, saving the deck as a text file containing the card names separated by new lines, named deck.txt.
